# Get started

The `mantra-py` lib provides 4 main modules:

- [`Wallet`](/wallet), to create addresses and send transactions.
- [`Client`](/client), to query blockchain information.
- [`TxBuilder`](/txbuilder), to interact with the blockchain.
- [`Webhooks`](/webhooks), to subscribe to on-chain events.
- [`Constants`](/constants), to get the chain configuration values.

Examples

- [`Webhooks API`](/webhooks), using the `Webhooks` module, it provides an API to subscribe to events from outside your program.
