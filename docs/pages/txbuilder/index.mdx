# Transaction Builder

The `TxBuilder` package allows the user to crate and sign cosmos transactions.

The `TxBuilder` class accepts an option argument to set the network, by default it will use `Mainnet`.

The builder assumes that you want to sign the message with your local wallet (`builder.sign_message`).

If you want to sign the message with an external wallet, you need to create a `Wallet` object with the private key and then use your external wallet to sign the `sign_doc`.

## Message Send Example

```py
from mantrapy.txbuilder.builder import TxBuilder
from mantrapy.wallet.wallet import wallet_from_mnemonic

TEST_MNEMONIC = 'anger pencil awful note doctor like slide muffin hungry keen appear eight barrel stone quiz candy loud blush load three analyst buddy health member'  # noqa: E501
w = wallet_from_mnemonic(TEST_MNEMONIC)

builder = TxBuilder(w, is_testnet=True)
body, auth, sign_doc = builder.bank_send('mantra1wf2eqtltm35tc5dllhp9uuzy66qvuwhve7zzgr', 1, 'uom')
resp = builder.broadcast_tx(body, auth, builder.sign_message(sign_doc))
```

## Internal functions

To generate the transaction, several internal functions are needed.

If you want to use some custom configuration you can use the `mantrapy.txbuilder.transactions` pkg.
