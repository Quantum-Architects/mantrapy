## Event Query Format

Webhook queries are customizable to match specific blockchain event conditions, with the following supported parameters:

- **module**: Filters by blockchain module (e.g., `module=staking`).
- **type**: Filters by event type (e.g., `type=transfer`).
- **attribute**: Filters by event attribute (e.g., `attribute=sender`).
- **value**: Filters by specific event value (e.g., `value=mantra1...`).
- **address**: Filters by account address activity (e.g., `address=mantra1...`).
- **contract**: Filters by smart contract address activity (e.g., `contract=mantra1...`).

It is possible to make a combination of these. Events will be filtered in the order especified in the query.

Example Query: `"module=bank&value=/cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MsgSend"`

## Error Handling

All error responses include a detail field to explain the reason for the failure.

- **400 Bad Request**: Returned for invalid queries or data inputs.
- **404 Not Found**: Returned if a requested webhook ID does not exist.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Server encountered an error processing the request.
