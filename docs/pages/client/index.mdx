# Client

Mantrapy includes a client to interact with the Mantra network via:

- **API**: to execute queries or transaction against the application.
- **RPC**: to execute queries or transactions against Comet BFT.

## Mantra client

### Instantiate the client
```py
client = Client(api_endpoint, rpc_endpoint, timeout, max_retries)
```

Where it possible to specify API and RPC endpoints for testnet or mainnet, the
timeout of each request, and the number of retries if a request fails.

### Query

All queries performed via the mantrapy client return a `QueryResponse` type
which wrap the returned data, the response status, and the possible error.

#### Account

It is possible to query the account information associated with an address:
```py
get_account(address: str) -> QueryResponse[QueryAccountResponse]:
```

#### Balances

It is possible to get all balances of an account via:

```py
get_balances(address: str) -> QueryResponse[QueryBalancesResponse]:
```

#### Delegations

It is possible to get all delegations of an account via:

```py
get_delegator_delegations(address: str) -> QueryResponse[QueryDelegatorDelegationsResponse]:
```

#### Staking rewards

It is possible to retrieve all rewards accrued by an account via:

```py
get_delegation_total_rewards(address: str) -> QueryResponse[QueryDelegationTotalRewardsResponse]:
```

#### Latest block height

It is possible to retrieve the last block height:

```py
get_height() -> QueryResponse[str]:
```
#### Latest block hash

It is possible to retrieve the last block hash:

```py
get_last_hash() -> QueryResponse[str]:
```

#### Block

It is possible to retrieve a block's information using the height:

```py
get_block_by_height(height: int) -> QueryResponse[ResultBlock]:
```

Or via its hash:

```py
get_block_by_hash(hash: str) -> QueryResponse[ResultBlock]:
```

#### Trasnsaction

It is possible to query a transaction given its hash value:

```py
get_tx_by_hash(hash: str) -> QueryResponse[ResultTx]:
```

### Transactions

#### Broadcasting a transaction

The mantrapy client can be used to broadcast any signed transaction via:

```py
broadcast(tx) -> str:
```

Please, refer to the transaction builder documentation to understand how to
create a signed transaction.

## Examples

### Execute a query

To execute a query, you first have to instantiate the Client as described in the
previous section, and then call the method you want to execute as in the example
below:

```py
from mantrapy.client.client import Client
from mantrapy.constants.constants import Constants

constants = Constants()
client = Client(constants.api_endpoint, constants.rpc_endpoint)
block_resp = client.get_block_by_height(1)
# Status of the request
print(block_resp.status_code)
# Content of the request
print(block_resp.data)
```

Where the `Constant` class contains the endpoints for both mainnet and testnet.

You can find more query examples in the `./examples/queries/` folder.
